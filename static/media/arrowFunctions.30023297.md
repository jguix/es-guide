Arrow functions replace the traditional `function` syntax to simplify writing functions. 

The syntax is very simple: `(args) => { content of the function }`. 

If the function only has one single parameter, you can omit the parentheses.

If the function has a single statement, you can omit the brackets, then the statement would be implicit returned. For instance: 

`const sum10 = number => number + 10;`
